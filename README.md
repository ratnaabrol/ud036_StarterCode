# Udacity Project - Movie Trailer website

Note: the instructions below use commands ```python``` and ```pip```. Please replace these as appropriate depending on your python installation (e.g. ```python3``` or ```pip3```).

## Prerequisites
Note: The version requirements below are so strict because this project was built with specific versions of tools and libraries and has only been tested with those versions.

### Global Prerequisites
* python (v3.6.1)

### Distribution Prerequisites
* wheel (v0.29.0): ```pip install 'wheel==0.29.0```

### Usage Prerequisites
(these dependencies will be installed when installing the distribution wheel)
* requests (v2.17.3): ```pip install requests==2.17.3```

### Testing Prerequisites
* coverage (v4.4.1): ```pip install coverage==4.4.1```

## Distribution
To create distributable wheel, in the project root:
```
$> python setup.py bdist_wheel
```
This will create a ```dist``` directory and a wheel archive within it.

## Installation
To install the wheel:
```
$> pip install <wheel_file>
```
where ```<wheel_file>``` is the distribution wheel (see above).

## Usage
Once installed, usage can be found by running:
```
$> python -m movie_project -h
Usage: movie_project [options]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -d FILE, --data-file=FILE
                        reads movie specification from data file. JSON format
                        array containing object with keys 'title' and 'year'
```

To generate a static website containing default data:
```
$> python -m movie_project
```

This will generate  a file called ```fresh_tomatoes.html``` in the directory the above command was run, as well as the following progress output to console:

```

Retrieving film data...
Found: 'Unforgiven' (1992) -> Unforgiven (Some legends will never be forgotten. Some wrongs can never be forgiven.)
Found: 'Edge of Tomorrow' (2014) -> Edge of Tomorrow (Live, Die, Repeat)
Found: 'Ghostbusters' (2016) -> Ghostbusters (Who You Gonna Call?)
Found: 'Sunshine' (2007) -> Sunshine (If the sun dies, so do we.)
Found: 'Moana' (2016) -> Moana (The ocean is calling.)
Found: 'Alien' (1979) -> Alien (In space no one can hear you scream.)
Error: No data for 'dasdaasa' (100)
... retrieval complete.
```
Note that the ```Error:``` line is expected output and demonstrates how the application copes with data that can't be looked up.

To generate a static website containing custom data, provide a json file containing an array of film data:

```
$> python -m movie_project -d my_favorite_movies.json

```

where ```my_favorite_movies.json``` contained the following

```json

  {"title":"starship troopers", "year":1997},
  {"title":"maltese falcon", "year":1941},
  {"title":"pi", "year":1998}
]
```

## Testing
